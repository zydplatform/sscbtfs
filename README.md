# Small Scale Cross Border Trader Facilitation System (SSCBTFS)

SSCBTFS is of substantial importance in African countries. The existence of marked price differences due to variations in production capacities, trade barriers, and regulatory compliance costs, combined with the absence of geographical or social separators, motivate many individuals to trade small consignments across borders. These transactions are not appropriately captured by the Customs Authorities, nor are they recorded in official trade statistics and generally not taken into consideration by policymakers and various stakeholders. Information on SSCBT imports and exports can benefit economic policy processes in several ways. At the macroeconomic level, SSCBT together with Customs-recorded trade can reveal the true extent of a country’s imports and exports and, thus, alter the balance of payments and the way the Central Bank manages macroeconomic risk.

## Quick Start

- [Run the Web Application](https://crossborder.netlify.app/cross-border)
- Clone the repo: `...`

#### <i>Prerequisites</i>
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.js®` and an `npm` package manager.

###### Node.js
Angular 14 requires `Node.js` version `^14.15` or `^16.10`.

- To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

###### Angular CLI
Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installation

``` bash
$ npm install
```

### Basic usage

``` bash
# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:4200
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```bash
# build for production with minification
$ npm run build
```
## What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
